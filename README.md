# CeMoQu (Cerebellum Motion Quantitative)

**Digital biomarkers for ataxia: CeMoQu goes beyond the traditional SARA scale, enabling patients to perform self-assessments that objectively evaluate motor and speech functions through a web-based system.**

---

## ✨ Features

* Self-assessment tasks for patients with ataxia and cerebellar disorders
* Quantitative motor & speech evaluation (line tracing, finger chase, speech clarity)
* Web-based, lightweight, and cross-platform (PC & tablet)
* Cloud-ready for secure, large-scale data storage

---

## 🧩 Modules

* **Vertical Test** – line tracing accuracy & deviation
* **Random Target Touch Test** – reaction time & precision
* **Speech Analysis Module** – clarity, rhythm, and fluency
* **Data Export** – CSV with millisecond & sub-millimeter precision

---

## 🎯 Goals

* Provide objective, digital biomarkers for clinical trials
* Reduce patient burden with remote monitoring
* Enable multi-site collaboration and data sharing
* Support regulatory-ready endpoints for drug development

---

## 🚀 Roadmap

* **Sep 2025** – Prototype (Vertical Test, data metrics, CSV export)
* **Oct 2025** – Random Target Touch Test, Speech Module
* **Dec 2025** – Pilot test with UCLA Ataxia Lab (20–30 participants)
* **2026** – Expand modules, automated reporting, multi-site collaboration
