# CeMoQu (Cerebellum Motion Quantitative)

**Digital biomarkers for ataxia: CeMoQu goes beyond the traditional SARA scale, enabling patients to perform self-assessments that objectively evaluate motor and speech functions through a web-based system.**

---

## âœ¨ Features

* Self-assessment tasks for patients with ataxia and cerebellar disorders
* Quantitative motor & speech evaluation (line tracing, finger chase, speech clarity)
* Web-based, lightweight, and cross-platform (PC & tablet)
* Cloud-ready for secure, large-scale data storage

---

## ðŸ§© Modules

* **Vertical Test** â€“ line tracing accuracy & deviation
* **Random Target Touch Test** â€“ reaction time & precision
* **Speech Analysis Module** â€“ clarity, rhythm, and fluency
* **Data Export** â€“ CSV with millisecond & sub-millimeter precision

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

* Provide objective, digital biomarkers for clinical trials
* Reduce patient burden with remote monitoring
* Enable multi-site collaboration and data sharing
* Support regulatory-ready endpoints for drug development

---

## ðŸš€ Roadmap

* **Sep 2025** â€“ Prototype (Vertical Test, data metrics, CSV export)
* **Oct 2025** â€“ Random Target Touch Test, Speech Module
* **Dec 2025** â€“ Pilot test with UCLA Ataxia Lab (20â€“30 participants)
* **2026** â€“ Expand modules, automated reporting, multi-site collaboration
