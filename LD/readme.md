# 🧠 Line Drawing Test

A browser-based application for **quantitative motor function assessment**, designed to evaluate coordination and tremor severity in patients with **cerebellar ataxia**.  
This app simulates clinical movement tests such as line-tracing and directional control, automatically generating **SARA-compatible subscores** based on deviation, discontinuity, and turn metrics.

## 🩺 Overview

The **Ataxia Diagnostic Suite** allows clinicians or researchers to run upper-limb coordination tests remotely using only a computer and camera or touchscreen.  
Each test involves tracing between targets on a canvas while the system tracks movement precision and stability. Results are automatically analyzed and presented as **quantitative scores** that correspond to the **SARA (Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia)**.

## ⚙️ Features

- **Four Built-In Tests**
  - Vertical, Horizontal, and two Diagonal Line Tests.
- **Real-Time Scoring**
  - Tracks deviation, discontinuity, turn count, and out-of-bounds frequency.
- **SARA-Based Evaluation**
  - Computes and displays a subscore (0–4) for each movement dimension.
- **Patient Management**
  - Register and recall patient profiles (stored locally in the browser).
- **Data Export**
  - Save results as structured `.json` files for further analysis.
- **Dark Mode**
  - Easily toggle between light and dark themes.
- **Offline Support**
  - Runs fully offline; no server required.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone or download** this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, or Firefox).
3. Register a patient.
4. Choose a test (e.g., *Vertical Test*).
5. Use your mouse or touchscreen to trace from **S** (Start) to **F** (Finish).
6. Review results in the **Clinical Score Mapping** section.
7. Export your data if desired.

## 🧠 Clinical Relevance

The **SARA Subscore** calculation is inspired by the official **SARA motor coordination assessment**, offering a digital alternative to manual observation.
This enables remote monitoring, self-assessment, and clinical research on motor control.
